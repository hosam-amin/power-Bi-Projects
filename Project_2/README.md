## Introduction

I created this Data Jobs Dashboard 2.0 to demonstrate my skills in data analysis and visualization while exploring the 2024 data science job market. Using a real dataset of job postings (covering titles, salaries, and locations), I cleaned, transformed, and visualized the data to uncover key trends and insights. The goal was not only to organize scattered information into one clear view, but also to showcase my ability to turn raw data into an interactive and decision-friendly dashboard.
