## Introduction

I built this dashboard to showcase my skills in data analysis and visualization by exploring the 2024 data science job market. Using a real dataset of job postings (including titles, salaries, and locations), I cleaned, transformed, and visualized the data to highlight key trends and insights. The goal was not just to solve the challenge of scattered information, but also to demonstrate my ability to turn raw data into an intuitive, decision-friendly tools.
